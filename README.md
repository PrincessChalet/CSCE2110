# CSCE2110

This is a repo for all of my programming assignments for Foundations 2 at University of North Texas.

Program 1: Dr. Sweany gave us his implementation of a characteristic vector. He wanted us to use his main file, but create our own implementation of Sets using lists. The Set.h file contains all of my function prototypes and my Set.cpp contains all of my function definitions.
