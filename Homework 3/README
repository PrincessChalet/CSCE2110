I have not chosen the larger program.

To compile:

g++ ClassScheduler.cpp
./a.out < <input file>

*** I am including the test.txt file that I used to create the schedule, so the <input file> would be test.txt.
This program schedules classes into rooms for either 50 minutes or 90 minuets on MWF or TR.
